= Opening our doors =

Since the creation of the project and publication in the PHP-Classes site, it had been downloaded by many PHP developers around the world. Also, some authors request that the project should have an official Roadmap, and a better website. 
   * *New web-site www.phpajax.org*: This domain will be the new website of the project. The release date is March 22th, 2008.
   * *New tracking support*: As the title said, _opening our doors_, the doors will be opened, and therefore any one will be able to help PHPAjax growth. People will be able to help, even if they do not code for the project. For made that possible, Cesar Rodas will write a CVSTrac like web application (the source will be protected under a GPL License) with some of this features:
      * Ticket support: Useful to report a bug, request new feature, send documentation, etc.
      * Wiki and documentation.
      * Source code browsing.
      * Timeline
      

= PHPAjax it self =

The PHPAjax project will *rewrite* from the scratch. This rewrite of PHPAjax will focusing in:
    * Better syntax: Stripping what is redundant.
    * JavaScript module: Offer freedom to the developer to code in javascript, even when he doesn't know it.
    * Fix many bugs.
    * Improve the code: All the code will be modular, it will be a extensible *core* in PHP and in Javascript (.js file). Therefore every feature (actual or future) will be like a plug-in.
    * Improve actual features:
      * File upload
      * Hotkey
    * Add new feature:
      * Cache support in client.
      * Suggestions ?
