= Introduction =

PHPAJAX has upgrade to a new version toward an easiest project.


= Details =

Here are the most important details of the new version:
  * Deleting the "inputs()" method instead of this method you can define inputs with the inputs methods.
  * Adding hotkey support, this mean that you can trigger action when a key (or group of keys) is pressed.

= How to upgrade =

== Old version ==
{{{
class foo extends phpajax {
    function inputs() {
        aread("input1");
    }
}

class bar extends phpajax {
    function inputs() {
        aread("input2");
        aread("input3");
    }
}
}}}

== New Version ==
{{{
class foo extends phpajax {
    var $inputs="input1";
   
}

class bar extends phpajax {
    var $inputs=array("input2","input3");   
}
}}}

= New feature, the hotkey =
You can trigger action when a key (or group of keys) is pressed. The group of keys is control, shift or alt with another key.

{{{
class foo extends phpajax {
    var $inputs="input1";
    var $hotkeys="b";
   
}

class bar extends phpajax {
    var $inputs=array("input2","input3");   
    var $hotkeys=array("a","shift-b","ctrl-x");
}
}}}
